README

This directory contains files which could be used 
to create routine's introductions for ProTex documentation system.
The routine or module's introduction will become the subsection of 
LaTeX section, thus saving the conceptual hierarchy.

PrologIntro.txt    is to be used for the  occasional introduction 
			to a long file

PrologModule.txt   is to be used for your f90 module definition

PrologIRoutine.txt is to be used for subroutines/functions that come 
			after a CONTAINS statement, i.e., routines 
			internal to a Module or subroutine.

PrologRoutine.txt  is to be used for your usual subroutine/functions (read: 
			not internal)
			Routines can either be Fortran90 subroutines, 
			functions or main programs, which are not part 
			of a module (for routines inside a module use 
			!IROUTINE:).
